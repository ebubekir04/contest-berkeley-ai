## Project Overview

This repository contains our agent for the Pacman Capture the Flag contest. Teams competed by building agents to play against each other.

We chose a **standard, low-risk setup**:  
- **One dedicated defensive agent** to protect our side  
- **One offensive agent** to collect points  
This allowed us to minimize risks and ensure steady performance, rather than betting on complex or risky strategies.
